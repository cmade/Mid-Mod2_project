# Technologies used:

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) was also used.

Data hard coded from the [Github api](https://api.github.com/users)

Wireframe created using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/IX2vOv4iitso6jQvbIQyAj/Wireframe_Mid_Mod2_Project?node-id=0%3A1)

Heroku was used to deploy the app: Click this link to view the [Mid Mod Project 2](https://mid-mod2project.herokuapp.com/)

# The approach taken:

There was a mixture of functional and class based components used in the project.

At least 3 components were created: UserItem, User and Navbar.

There was use of States & Props between the components

# Unsolved problems:

I wanted to use the api to update the state, but will implement this in the future.

# User stories:

1. Create wireframe in Figma
2. User Story: Create a navbar component.
3. User Story: Create a user component to house the state and map through the state while passing the data to the user item component.
4. User Story: Create a user item component to display each github profile user.
5. Initialize github repo
6. Deploy to Heroku

# Notes:

This was a good learning experience.
